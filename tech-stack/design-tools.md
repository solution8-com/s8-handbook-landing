# Design tools

We have experience using a variety of tools across different projects with both clients and internally at Solution8. Our toolset is not set in stone but rather a collection of tools at our disposal to use as a project requires it.

## Brainstorming and workshopping

**[Miro](https://miro.com/)** - Miro is used widely across Solution8 as a digital whiteboard and sandbox for all sorts of different activities. We use it for our interview process, workshops, brainstorming, research synthesis, diagramming, retros, and a lot more. Solution8 has a team account which everyone is welcome and encouraged to use. A few projects have their own Miro spaces separate from Solution8’s account. You’ll receive invites to those accounts separately if your project requires them.

## Wireframing, visual design, and prototyping

**[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)** - Figma is the go-to design tool for collaboration and prototyping. With AI it becomes the starting point for a software factory.

## Documentation and version control

**[Github](https://github.com/)** - We are using Github more and more for documentation organization and project planning. We have been experimenting with using Github wikis to document our research and design work, and using Github projects to organize simple KanBan boards to plan and prioritize our work.

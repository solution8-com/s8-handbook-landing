# How we work


As solutioneers at Solution8, we have a wealth of opportunities to both learn and deepen our expertise of good design practices of software systems (our other work nonwithstanding), as well as teach and share these practices to fellow Solution8 team members and our clients.

## Sharing with and learning from our teammates

More brains are better than one, so we must take every opportunity possible to share with and learn from others on our team. We meet several times every week to talk through team developments or learnings, share work, or run a retro together. 

**Critiques and share-outs**  
We aim to regularly share in-progress work for feedback and to learn from one another. Sometimes these are more formal critiques, and sometimes they’re just to share something interesting that might be useful to others. 

## Bringing a fresh systems thinking perspective to Solution8 

Solution8 loosely (at the moment) follows [Sociocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy), where you can lend your time and expertise to help improve the organization. You can easily find these groups by searching “c-” for committees, “g-” for guilds, and “wg-” for working groups in Slack.

With MS Teams as our main comms platform, you will probably already be a member of several circles. Due to the early stage of the firm, we still have circles starting and stopping all the time, but certain longstanding circles are already emerging (and need to be defended against bastardization):

**[tech circle]()**: With six members, this is the biggest circle that we have, which is not surprising given that technology is our core subject matter. Technically (no pun intended), the text circle should not be a "project update meeting circle"; that would be more relevant in a project management circle. Because we are short on capital and people, we're merging a lot of roles onto those shouldering technical delivery, which we will correct as soon as growth allows!

**[optimization circle [defunct]]()**: A circle that has since merged into "Always On" mindsets that we have cultivated durign the Friday Forums.

**[diamond circle]()**: This circle is directly and inseparably connected to project diamond, which is our long-term project for spinning out products with significant traction that should become their own companies, entities with different ownership structures.

**[sales circle (informal)]()**: As a technology agency, we are heavily dependent on projects, and projects are sold and closed by people in the sales circle. We don't have a formally established circle structure due to our small team size, but what we can already see is that this is the key business function that we really should support with technology whenever time between projects allows.

**[commercialization circle]()**:  this is a very fresh circle that has been emerging since early February, specifically involving junior Turk Circle members, but also Niels, who's bringing his experience and fluency in business value lingo to the table to help 'the rubber meet the road' between looking for diamonds and delivering on projects. This circle is tasked withg enabling low-hanging fruit opportunities for 'passive cashflow', be it from licenses or operating leightweight SaaS. Why leightweight? Well, imagine your Smartphone could just listen to your problems and solve them with raw intelligence. Would you buy any SaaS subscription if the law doesn't force you to?

## Representing design in sales scopings and proposals

We are fortunate to have a business development powerhouse (Jacob) that prioritizes participation and input in the sales process. All scoping calls with prospective commercial clients include a member of the tech circle or commercialization circle so that we can ensure someone from the practice can vet the opportunity, understand the needs of the client, help determine staffing, and assist with writing the offer.

Dawid, Kasper and Martin helped design a [streamlined diagram](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVIgwqhQ4=/?moveToWidget=3458764638066809263&cot=14) that details every client and internal touchpoint from the prospect stage to getting the deal signed. The [Involving Solution8 team members in Sales Playbook]() doesn't yet exist - it should outline exactly when and how solutioneers get brought into the sales process, what the expectations are, and the current list of folks who are designated to assist with this effort. Since we are stiull lacking repeatability of our workloads, there are multiple solutions in the air, from a Sales Engineering MCP to a customGPT to what the diagram says. This needs to be finalized in the coming weeks.

## Work management principles & practices

How we think about and organise work matters just as much as the work itself. The following principles guide how Solution8 sets direction, runs cycles, and ships things that matter — without generating unnecessary process overhead.

**Principles (summary):**
- **Build for the creators** — the people doing the work are the first users of any process or tool
- **Purpose-built** — everything should have a clear reason for existing
- **Create momentum, don't sprint** — steady progress beats short bursts of intensity
- **Meaningful direction** — every piece of work connects to a goal that matters
- **Aim for clarity** — ambiguity is the enemy of good work
- **Say no to busy work** — not all activity is productive; eliminate what doesn't move things forward
- **Simple first, then powerful** — start simple; add complexity only when necessary
- **Decide and move on** — make decisions with available information, document them, and keep moving

[See the full Work management principles & practices page](../work-management) for the complete set of principles and how we apply them in practice (projects, cycles, backlogs, specs, changelogs, and more).

## Working with teammates and clients on projects

There is no “typical” project here at Solution8 (yet), so there is no “typical” solutioneer handbook to run one, but there are some practices I hold near and dear, which are partially formalized below:

**Team norming**  
Every new project is a new problem to solve and potentially a brand new mix of people to solve it with — which is why we care so deeply about team norming and building a foundation of trust.

- **BICEPS:** Understand what is important to each person working on the project and what motivates us.
- **Superpowers and kryptonite:** Understand each person’s self-identified strengths and areas for improvement.
- **Contribute, lead, learn:** Understand the work areas each person wants to contribute to, lead, and learn more about.

In addition to these activities, I consider it critically important to for the entire internal team to know how decisions will be made, who will be involved, and how 
they will be documented. In the past, I worked in envs with a robust practice of using [decision records](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record) to document decisions on both a company and project level. Given the speed at which changesd aqnd work happens, this is not something that is practical, but the need for documentation is there, no doubt. This might turn out to become an internal product. TBD.

**Discovery and framing**  
We regularly push clients to include an Opportunity Mapping (some call it Discovery and Framing) period at the start of each project to ensure we are all aligned on user needs, business goals, and stakeholder priorities before we settle on a solution. If there is a common thread in almost all of our projects, it’s this, and as the experts, we’re often leading the charge on this effort, which can be challenging, as the majority of the world is not prepared for structured approaches (well, most likely not willing ot pay). 

In a nutshell, Opportunity Mapping is a simplified, streamlined and compressed version of the [Double Diamond Process](https://www.designpsykologi.dk/hvad-er-double-diamond):

```
1. Understand the problem space
    - Onboard client to mindset
    - Align on access and tooling
    - Have a `pre-mortem` internally and talk through anti-goals
    - Review past research and identify assumptions and gaps
    - Map current workflows
    - Map stakeholders and their scale of influence

2. Conduct stakeholder and user research
    - Write interview scripts
    - Recruit, schedule, and conduct interviews
    - Synthesize information (create/update user archetypes, user needs, pain points, journey maps, service blueprints, etc)
    - Collaborate with stakeholders to prioritize needs and create experiments roadmap to test ideas

3. Experiment with potential solutions
    - Run test sessions with stakeholders and users to validate solutions rapidly
    - Design low-fidelity prototypes to test with stakeholders and users
    - Synthesize findings and share recommendations
    - Create an outcome-based roadmap and project plan to move forward
```

As you can tell, this is a very detailed approach that, given the hype and magical expectations in software, simply doesn't work yet. Opportunity Mapping is simpler, speaks into business value and cost first, demonstrates value within days of kickoff (or even before) and relies heavily on visual aids to communicate. [Find details here] (https://airadgivning.sharepoint.com/sites/AIRdgivning/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FAIRdgivning%2FShared%20Documents%2FBusiness%20Consulting%2FBusiness%20Consulting%20Workshops&viewid=82984b62%2Dc2a6%2D4eb2%2Dab3c%2D22d797fdf0c3&FolderCTID=0x012000364B12E1DBF10041B035055D2BF325C8).

While every project approaches this work a little bit differently, there’s value in having a shared library of resources to pull from. We have several Miroboards, GitHub Repos, Word Documents (!) in Sharepoint with our procedures all over the place. easy-to-copy templates for many of the activities listed above. Some [resources](../resources/resources) I have brought over from the past can be found in the Resources section of this handbook.


## Sharing good design practices company-wide

In the life cycle of Solution8, solutioneering is a relatively new practice, so when an opportunity presents itself to share solutioneering practices and work with the entire company, we take it. 

Most Friday Afternoons, we conduct our Firday Forums. Usually, the process is fixed and takes around 90 minutes, which leaves a 30 minute slot open for any team member to present on a topic to the rest of the Solution8 team.

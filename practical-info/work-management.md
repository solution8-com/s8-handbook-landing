# Work management principles & practices

A set of guiding principles and concrete practices for how we think about and manage work at Solution8 — from setting strategic direction down to scoping individual issues.

## Principles

### Build for the creators

The people doing the work are the first users of any system or process we put in place. If our tooling and workflows don't serve them well, nothing else will.

### Purpose-built

Everything we build — processes, tools, features — should have a clear reason for existing. Avoid generic solutions when a focused one will serve better.

### Create momentum – don't sprint

Sustained, steady progress beats short-lived bursts of intensity. We aim for a rhythm that teams can maintain over the long term without burning out.

### Meaningful direction

Work should always connect to a goal that matters. If you can't explain why a piece of work exists, it probably shouldn't.

### Aim for clarity

Ambiguity is the enemy of good work. Write things down, make decisions explicit, and communicate intentions clearly.

### Say no to busy work

Not all activity is productive. We actively identify and eliminate work that doesn't move us forward — unnecessary meetings, redundant processes, and low-value tasks.

### Simple first, then powerful

Start with the simplest solution that solves the problem. Add complexity only when simplicity has proven insufficient.

### Decide and move on

Indecision is costly. Make decisions with the information available, document them, and keep moving. Revisit only when new information warrants it.

## Practices

### Set strategic product initiatives

Define high-level initiatives that give the team a shared sense of direction. These sit above individual projects and help everyone understand what we are optimising for in a given period.

### Connect daily work to larger goals with projects

Every project should trace back to a strategic initiative. This keeps day-to-day tasks grounded in purpose and makes it easier to deprioritise work that doesn't fit.

### Work in n-week cycles

Structure work into fixed-length cycles (the exact length depends on the team and context). Cycles create natural checkpoints for reflection, re-prioritisation, and communication with stakeholders.

### Keep a manageable backlog

A backlog that nobody can navigate is worse than no backlog. Regularly prune, group, and prioritise items so the backlog stays actionable and trustworthy.

### Mix feature and quality work

Shipping only new features leads to compounding technical and UX debt. Deliberately schedule quality, reliability, and improvement work alongside feature delivery in every cycle.

### Specify project and issue owners

Every project and every issue should have one named owner who is accountable for its outcome. Shared ownership often means no ownership.

### Write project specs

Before starting significant work, write a short spec that captures the goal, the approach, and the definition of done. This surfaces misalignments early and reduces rework.

### Understand your users

Ground decisions in real user needs. Regularly conduct research, review usage data, and talk to the people who will be affected by what you build.

### Scope issues to be as small as possible

Small, well-defined issues are easier to estimate, review, and ship. Break large chunks of work down until each issue can be completed in a short, focused session.

### Measure progress with actual work

Velocity is measured by shipped work, not story points or hours logged. Demonstrate progress through working software, published designs, or completed deliverables.

### Run cross-functional teams

The best outcomes come from teams where design, engineering, product, and other relevant disciplines work together from the start — not in sequential handoffs.

### Write a changelog

Document what ships and why. A changelog is a communication tool for stakeholders and a historical record for the team. It also builds a habit of shipping something worth talking about.
